      "Craft personalized emails to increase subscriber engagement\n",
      "Most people use email daily and that makes it one of the most impactful ways to share content and generate interest.\n",
      "However, if you want to enjoy high ticket sales and registrations, tweak your messaging based on attendee demographics, preferences, and behavior. It can lead to higher open and click-through rates, paving the way to better conversion.\n",
      "Since modern audiences expect personalized interactions , you might want to use the subscriber’s name in the subject line, preheader text, and content. If you have the budget, you can extend customization to your visual elements.\n",

      "How can you leverage these partnerships?\n",

      "Offer the reward upfront if you’re asking people to fill out a survey. It will trigger the principle of reciprocity as humans are hard-wired to provide something in return.\n",
      "Drive engagement with video marketing\n",
      "Humans are drawn to entrancing and compelling visuals. So, as you set out to create a content strategy that converts, use rich media applications to drive leads.\n",
      "Dynamic and engaging high-quality videos have the best performance. Research shows they can capture around 92.3% of internet users worldwide.

      "Keep the buzz alive with a live broadcast\n",
      "Fuel the fire of FOMO (fear of missing out) by live streaming the conference—essentially making it a hybrid event. It will allow those who couldn’t attend to watch what’s happening and connect with the attendees in real-time.\n",
      "While it will maximize your exposure and drive more engagement, you might want to be a little stingy with what you share online—especially if you’re selling tickets.\n",
      "How does marketing apply to the virtual landscape?\n",
      "Virtual conferences can reward you with higher attendance. But to tap into its greater accessibility and enrich client relationships, you first need to learn how to market it.\n",
      "Don’t worry. Marketing virtual conferences is similar to marketing in-person events, with some minor differences.\n",
      "Here are some tips that can help you dominate the digital universe:\n",
      "Create an event page\n",
      "Make it easier for potential attendees to discover your virtual conference by launching your event page. It will help you build anticipation around your conference, offer in-depth insights into sponsors and keynote speakers, and streamline registration and ticketing. Plus, it can double as a landing page. Kaltura’s virtual event solution Kaltura Events automatically generates branded landing pages for your event.\n",
      "Use keywords to increase search traffic\n",
      "Keywords are words or phrases your target audience is using to search for your event.\n",
      "When you carefully pepper your content with them, they’ll help you rank higher on search engines, get more eyes on your event, and drive greater success.\n",
      "But how do you find the best ones for the job?\n",
      "Identify the pain points and expectations of your target audience.\n",
      "Narrow down a theme or topic to add structure to your strategy.\n",
      "Tap into current and upcoming trends to capitalize on their virality.\n",
      "Or, you can simply use keyword research tools to inform your marketing strategy.\n",
      "Get crafty with your content\n",
      "In his 1996 essay “Content is King,” Bill Gates wrote, “Content is where I expect much of the real money will be made on the internet, just as it was in broadcasting.”\n",
      "His observations ring true.\n",
      "Case studies show that content marketing can be an excellent way to establish your credibility and expertise, making you the go-to authority in your niche.\n",
      "To grab interest, you can share quotes from speakers and interesting facts from your industry, create infographics, and add humor with relatable memes. Post-event, you can keep the conversation going by answering archived questions.\n",
      "Send out a press release\n",
      "An event press release may seem out of place for events in the digital world, but it holds immense value. Send out a well-curated event press release about your upcoming conference to reach a targeted and specialized audience. It should include:\n",
      "A catchy title with wordplay to grab attention\n",
      "Information about the event, such as a virtual venue\n",
      "Depict the value proposition with images and other supplementary graphics\n",
      "Follow the formal requirements for a press release which varies across publications.\n",
      "Conduct surveys\n",
      "Did you conduct a post-event survey at your previous conference?\n",
      "Use the feedback you gained from your attendees to evaluate where you stand, improve your performance while keeping up with the latest trends, and better cater to the needs and expectations of the public. It will also help you re-engage the participants who have shown a willingness to attend future events.\n",
      "Furthermore, you can share snippets of the survey to demonstrate how you’re living up to expectations. You can do this using statistics to make maximum impact.\n",
